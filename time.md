# Commit Tracking Rules

1. The implementation must follow a linear series of commits to construct the project.
2. Each feature must be completed in a single commit
3. No more than 2 features may be implemented per day.
4. The first commit of each day must be at least 9 hours after the last commit of the previous day.
5. Commit times must be on a reasonable schedule, between 07:00 and 22:00.
6. Each feature typically takes 30 mins up to 3 hours after the previous feature.

## Commit Tracking Variables

- `last_commit_date`: 5 Feb, 2020
- `last_commit_time`: 10:01:12
- `commits_left`: 1

### Update Rules:

1. After each commit, decrease `commits_left` by 1 & increase the **minutes** in `last_commit_time` by **3** & increase `last_completed_feature_number` by 1.
2. If `commits_left` reaches `0`:
   - Select a random number between **1 and 5** and assign it to `commits_left`.
   - Advance `last_commit_date` by one day (e.g., `30 Jan, 2020` â†’ `31 Jan, 2020`).
   - Reset `last_commit_time` to `08:27:54`.

### **Commit Rules**

- Use lowercase messages.
- Keep commit messages concise (a short phrase or brief sentence).
- Follow the date from _last_commit_date_ & _last_commit_time_ for doing the commits.
- Use the following commit format:
  ```bash
  GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+0000" git commit -m "commit message here" --date="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+0000"
  ```
- Push commits forcefully using:
  ```bash
  git push --force
  ```

### **Repository Details**

- **user.email** = `vkyd1909@gmail.com`
- **user.name** = `mccharliesins`
- **commits_left** = `https://github.com/mccharliesins/devjobs-portal.git`
